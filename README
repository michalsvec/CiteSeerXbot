One of my oldest project in ruby.


CiteSeerX database parser
==============
It searches CiteSeeX database for papers containing specific keyword and downloads PDF file. 
Downloaded files are saved by first 4 letters from md5 hash of its name. 
Metadata are stored in database.



TODO: 
* translate comments
* upload database scheme
* use nokogiri instead of hpricot
* use bundler
