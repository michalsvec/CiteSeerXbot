One of my oldest project in ruby.


CiteSeerX database parser
==============
It searches CiteSeeX database for papers containing specific keyword and downloads PDF file. 
Downloaded files are saved by first 4 letters from md5 hash of its name. 
Metadata are stored in database.


Parser is made universal for any other database. It can search in many databases with more adapters.
But now, there's implementation only for CiteSeerX.
